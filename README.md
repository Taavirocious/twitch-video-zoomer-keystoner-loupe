# twitch-video-zoomer-keystoner-loupe
A fork of mogue's 'Chrome plugin for zoom on twitch.tv' (https://github.com/mogue/twitch-video-zoomer), adding a Keystoner and a resizable Magnifying Glass.


Zoomer and Loupe can be combined at the same time, i.e you could have an enlarged camera while simultaneously the rest of the video area can be decreased in size and in full view unobscured.

Keystoner functions as its own sole functionality, tilting the video for inopportunely placed monitors (or known in more severe cases of.... slouching), giving the illusion of even perspective.

+ Shortcuts:
  + Double click on Icon - Reset Zoomer, Keystoner & Loupe to Default.

+ Zoomer only shortcuts:
  + ESC         - Reset Zoomer only.
  + Shift & Z   - Overlay toggle.
  + Arrow Up    - Move video up.
  + Arrow Down  - Move video down.
  + Arrow Left  - Move video left.
  + Arrow Right - Move video right.
  + "+          - Zooms in.
  + "-"         - Zooms out.

Usage on Chromium based browsers:
1.  Download the repository and unzip it into a folder.
2.  Turn on Developer Mode.
3.  Head over to the browser's extentions page and hit "Load Unpacked".

Note: this will always read it from the folder you unpacked the .zip into, so consider the placement of it.
